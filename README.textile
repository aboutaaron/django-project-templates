h2. Django-project-templates

To clone this repo: 

pre. git clone -b postgis-2.0-django-1.5 --single-branch git://github.com/cirlabs/django-project-templates.git

This project contains templates for creating a new Django project. It's like running django-admin.py startproject but it creates a more complete application skeleton.

All you need to do is install the package from PyPi like so. Note that it will install PasteScript, Cheetah and Fabric. So you may want to create a new virtualenv.

pre. python easy_install django-project-templates

Alternatively you can install it from a git clone with:

pre. python setup.py install

And then creating a project skeleton is as simple as:

pre. paster create --template=django_project example_project

Note that this project skeleton is still in flux. It definitely contains some things that are personal preference but it hopefully makes up for it with useful tools like a reasonably complete fabric based deployment setup and configs for CruiseControl. And yes, more documentation would be nice.

h2. Heroku template

Drawing on work from the Chicago Tribune, we (the Center for Investigative Reporting) put together a project template for launching news apps in a Heroku environment. You can read more about it "here.":http://cironline.org/blog/post/heroku-news-apps-3415

pre. paster create --template=heroku_project project_name
